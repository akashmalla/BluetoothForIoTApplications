# BluetoothForIoTApplications

This paper gives an overview of how Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) works which was
introduced in Bluetooth v4 and how it can be enhanced to perform even better for large-scale
IoT deployments. It is clear that bluetooth 5 has significant improvement in data upload speed
and with an introduction of extended advertising mode for data transfer, it has the advantage
from advertising mode with random access to advertisements and, on the other hand, dedicated
data upload as in connection mode. Most of the users are using Bluetooth v4 right now and it is
important to come up with some solutions that is compatible with that version as many devices
do not support bluetooth 5 yet as it was recently released in December 2016. Also, when you
use BLE alone in a large-scale IoT scenario such as a retail store, it would be communicating
with lots of devices which would lead to contention and delays for data transfer. Therefore, this
paper focuses on solutions on top of BLE such as Opportunistic listening, smart LaBLE system
and Wake up Radios (WuR) in order to optimize BLEâ€™s performance.
